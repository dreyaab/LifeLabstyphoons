        <p class="p2">Inequality in Hollywood refers to the various forms of discrimination and social inequality in the American media industry. <br>There are many branches of the media industry, such as news, television, film, music, agencies, studios, to name some of <br>the major players. Gender inequality in Hollywood and the media is a long-established issue. Women have historically faced <br>challenges in terms of representation, pay disparity, stereotypical roles, and opportunities for leadership positions both <br>in front of and behind the camera.
            <br>
            <br>Behind the camera, women face an uphill battle, contending with limited opportunities to helm projects as directors, writers, or producers. Pay gaps remain pronounced, reflecting entrenched disparities that see female actors and professionals earning significantly less than their male counterparts. This pay inequity extends beyond actors to directors and executives, reflecting a broader systemic issue that undervalues the contributions of women in the industry.
            <br>
            <br>Moreover, the narrative landscape often confines women to stereotypical roles, reinforcing societal norms that constrain their portrayal and limit the breadth of their on-screen and behind-the-scenes opportunities. While advocacy movements and awareness campaigns have brought attention to these issues, the deep-seated structures of Hollywood persist in perpetuating biases that hinder the advancement of gender equality. Overcoming these challenges requires comprehensive reforms addressing institutional practices, cultural norms, and entrenched biases to create an inclusive and equitable environment for all genders within the entertainment industry.    </p>
